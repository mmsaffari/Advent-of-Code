# Advent of Code

This is my attempt to solve the [Advent Of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I'm learning to use Rust, so these attempts may get updated in the future.

The goal is to challenge my old DEV skills, and also learn to use this promissing langauge.

**Comments and improvements are welcome.**

If you would like to run these yourself, save your data in the appropriate `input.txt` file, under the `data` folder of the corresponding `day`, then run `cargo run` inside that day's folder.
